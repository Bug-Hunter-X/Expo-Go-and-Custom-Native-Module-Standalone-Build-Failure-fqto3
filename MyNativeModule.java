While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the interaction between Expo Go and a custom native module.  The error message was vague and didn't provide a clear solution. The app built fine on the Expo development server, but failed when built for standalone and run on Expo Go. The relevant code snippet from my native module is: 
```java
//MyNativeModule.java
public class MyNativeModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule{
    public MyNativeModule(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {
        super(reactContext);
    }
    @ReactMethod
    public void myMethod(String param, Promise promise){
        try{
            //some logic
            promise.resolve("Success");
        }catch (Exception e){
            promise.reject("error", e);
        }
    }
}
```
